# The Meet App

This project is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) built with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. The app uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

A user can type in an event location and the app will search for all upcoming events in the location. It will also give the users more details about the events if they choose to click on them. Aside from the list of events there is also a visual chart that represents the amount of upcoming events in the location.


## User Stories:

### Feature 1: Filter Events By City

#### - **Scenario 1: When user hasnâ€™t searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities.**
As a user <br/>
I should be able to see a list of upcoming events from all cities by default <br/>
So that it will help me make a decision about what events and locations to search for

#### - **Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city.**
As a user <br/>
I should be able to see a list of suggestions when searching for a city <br/>
So that I can find the city I'm looking for quicker and easier

#### - **Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list.**
As a user <br/>
I should be able to select a city from the suggested list of cities <br/>
So that I can search for event locations quicker and easier

### Feature 2: Show/Hide An Element

#### - **Scenario 1:** An event element is collapsed by default

As a user <br/>
I should be able to observe that an element has more details <br/>
So that I can choose to click on those details

#### - **Scenario 2:** User can expand an event to see its details

As a user <br/>
I should be able to click on a button to expand the event details <br/>
So that I can view the details

#### - **Scenario 3:** User can collapse an event to hide its details

As a user <br/>
I should be able to click a button to hide the event details <br/>
So I can continue to browse for other events


### Feature 3: Specify Number Of Events

#### - **Scenario 1:** When user hasn't specified a number, 32 is the default number

As a user <br/>
I should be able to see that the default number of listed events is 32 <br/>
So I can change that number should I choose to

#### - **Scenario 2:** User can change the number of events they want to see

As a user <br/>
I should be able to change the number of events listed <br/>
So I can tailor it to my specific needs


### Feature 4: Use The App When Offline

#### - **Scenario 1:** Show cached data when there's no internet connection

As a user <br/>
I should be able to view my cached data saved from my last session <br/>
So I can jump back into my event browsing

#### - **Scenario 2:** Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range)

As a user <br/>
I should be able to see an error message when I change the settings <br/>
So that I'm aware that the settings don't fit the event locations and times listed


### Feature 5: Data Visualization

#### - **Scenario 1:** Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city

As a user <br/>
I should be able to view a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city <br/>
So that I can immediately get an idea of the number of events in each city


## Gherkin Syntax:

### Feature 2: Show/Hide An Element

#### - **Scenario 1:** An event element is collapsed by default
Given that the user hasn't opened the event details <br/>
When the user views an event listing <br/>
Then the user should be able to see that the event has more details that they can click on

#### - **Scenario 2:** User can expand an event to see its details
Given that the user hasn't opened the event details <br/>
When the user clicks on a button <br/>
Then the user can expand the event details to view them

#### - **Scenario 3:** User can collapse an event to hide its details
Given that the user has already opened the event details <br/>
When the user clicks on a button <br/>
Then the user should be able to close the event details to keep browsing other events


### Feature 3: Specify Number Of Events

#### - **Scenario 1:** When user hasn't specified a number, 32 is the default number
Given that the user has already typed in an event location <br/>
When the user enters the event location <br/>
Then the user should see that the default number of listed events is 32

#### - **Scenario 2:** User can change the number of events they want to see
Given that the user has already entered an event location <br/>
When the user sees that the default number of listed events is 32 <br/>
Then the user should be able to change that number to suit their needs


### Feature 4: Use The App When Offline

#### - **Scenario 1:** Show cached data when there's no internet connection
Given that the user has previously used the app <br/>
When the user reopens the application offline <br/>
Then the user should be able to view their cached browsing data

#### - **Scenario 2:** Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range)
Given that the user has already browsed for event listings <br/>
When the user tries to change the settings <br/>
Then the user should be able to see an error message that the settings don't correspond with the listed events


### Feature 5: Data Visualization

#### - **Scenario 1:** Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city
Given that the user has already typed in an event location <br/>
When the user enters the event location <br/>
Then the user should be able to view a chart with the number of upcoming events in the location
